# Foggy Image Generation with Fog Simulator: FoHIS

This code is inspired by the paper titled "Towards Simulating Foggy and Hazy Images and Evaluating Their Authenticity."

GitHub repository: [FoHIS](https://github.com/noahzn/FoHIS).

## Depth Estimation Methods

We employ two methods to estimate depth:

1. **Depth-Anything**
   - Paper: Depth Anything: Unleashing the Power of Large-Scale Unlabeled Data
   - GitHub: [Depth-Anything](https://github.com/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything)

2. **MiDAS**
   - Paper: Towards Robust Monocular Depth Estimation: Mixing Datasets for Zero-shot Cross-dataset Transfer
   - GitHub: [MiDAS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS)
